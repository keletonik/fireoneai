FireOne AI (NSW Fire Safety Auditor Copilot) Mobile App Build
You are a master AI architect + lead mobile engineer + product designer. Build a production-grade mobile app called FireOne AI with the exact UI style shown in the provided design (white, minimalist, rounded chat bubbles, soft shadows, orange accent, clean enterprise feel) and the same FireOne logo. The app is an expert-level NSW fire safety compliance chatbot for auditors and fire safety professionals. It must ship to iOS (App Store) and Android (Google Play).
1) Product Goal
Deliver a fast, trustworthy, compliance-first chat assistant that answers NSW fire safety compliance questions with high precision, citations, and audit-ready structure. It must handle:
AFSS (Annual Fire Safety Statement) guidance and workflows
NCC/BCA questions (use “NCC” terminology; BCA legacy references acceptable)
Australian Standards references (where applicable)
Essential Fire Safety Measures (EFSM) and inspection/maintenance language
Practical auditor use-cases (e.g., FRLs, egress, stair pressurisation, detection, EWIS, hydrants/hose reels, smoke control), while staying within scope and providing disclaimers where necessary.
2) Non-Negotiable UX/UI Requirements (must match the mockups)
Implement the following UI exactly (do not redesign):
White background, subtle warm-grey surfaces
Rounded chat bubbles with soft shadow (low elevation), generous padding
Left-aligned user messages with a small circular avatar
Right/assistant messages with a FireOne icon/mark and distinct bubble styling
A clear header area showing:
FireOne AI logo + wordmark
Subtitle: “NSW Fire Safety Auditor Copilot”
Two or more suggested prompt chips (examples like AFSS, Class 2 essential measures)
Bottom input bar: rounded text field with placeholder
“Ask a fire safety compliance question…”
Send icon: orange paper-plane/arrow button
Typography: modern sans (SF Pro on iOS / Inter-like on Android) with consistent hierarchy
Colours: FireOne orange as primary accent; neutral greys for text and borders
3) Platforms & Stack
Use a cross-platform stack that achieves native performance:
Preferred: React Native + TypeScript (Expo if appropriate)
Alternatives acceptable if justified (Flutter, native Swift/Kotlin)
Must support:
iOS 16+ (or best-fit current)
Android 10+ (or best-fit current)
App Store & Google Play compliance-ready (privacy policy hooks, permissions minimal)
4) Core Features (MVP)
Chat
Streaming responses (token-by-token) for perceived speed
Message timestamps optional (off by default)
Copy-to-clipboard, long-press actions (copy, share, save)
Conversation memory per thread (threaded chats optional for MVP)
Trust & Compliance Output
Every answer must include:
“What this means” summary (plain English)
“Relevant references” section (NCC clause references, AS references when applicable)
“Assumptions” explicitly listed
“Next steps” checklist for an auditor
When the assistant is uncertain: clearly label uncertainty and request missing parameters.
Guardrails
No hallucinated standards or clauses.
If citation confidence is low, respond with:
“I’m not confident enough to cite this—please provide the clause/standard or context.”
Include a short disclaimer: “Not legal advice. Verify against current NCC/standards and local authority requirements.”
Prompt Suggestions
Pre-filled suggested questions (tap inserts into input):
“What is required for an AFSS in NSW?”
“What essential measures apply to a Class 2 building?”
“What FRL is required for [wall type] between [use areas]?”
“How do I approach stair pressurisation / tenability checks?”
Offline/Latency Strategy
Cache the last N conversations locally.
If offline: show cached content and block send with a clear banner.
5) Knowledge & Answering Engine
Use a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture:
Curated corpus of NSW compliance materials, NCC extracts, internal guidance notes, and safe summaries
Embed + retrieve with strict filters to prevent irrelevant sources
Provide citations tied to retrieved chunks (doc name + section)
Model strategy:
Use a strong general LLM + toolformer style retrieval
Enforce structured output via JSON schema internally, render to UI sections
Evaluation:
Build a test suite of 100+ NSW fire safety queries with expected citation behaviour and refusal cases.
6) Architecture (High-Level)
Mobile client:
UI + local cache + auth (optional) + analytics events (privacy-safe)
Backend API:
Auth (optional for MVP)
Chat orchestration, streaming
Retrieval service (vector DB)
Observability (request IDs, latency, error types)
Data:
Vector store (Pinecone/Weaviate/pgvector)
Document store with versioning (to keep standards updates traceable)
7) Store Launch Requirements
App metadata prepared:
Name: FireOne AI
Subtitle: NSW Fire Safety Auditor Copilot
Keywords aligned to “fire safety compliance”, “AFSS”, “NCC”
Ensure:
Minimal permissions
Clear privacy disclosure (no selling data)
Crash-free baseline and performance metrics
8) Deliverables Required From You
Produce, in order:
Final UI spec (components, spacing, typography, colours) matching the mockups
Full technical architecture diagram (client/backend/RAG)
API contracts (request/response schemas)
Data model for chat + citations + doc versions
Security & privacy model (threats + mitigations)
Implementation plan (milestones for iOS + Android release)
A short demo script and 10 screenshot-ready example conversations
9) Constraints
Keep everything enterprise professional and regulator-safe.
Maintain strict correctness: no invented clauses/standards.
Must look and feel like the provided FireOne interface (no creative deviation).
